- Build strong relationships with stakeholders and promote a [FinOps culture](docs\_docs\framework\capabilities\manage\culture.md) within the organization.
- Develop a growth and maturity plan for the team's skills and capabilities.

<br>

## üèóÔ∏è Building on the basics

- Form a dedicated FinOps team with diverse skills and adequate resources.
- Provide continuous [training and skill development](docs\_docs\framework\capabilities\manage\education.md) for team members.
- Regularly review and refine the FinOps strategy to ensure alignment with organizational objectives.
- Foster a culture of collaboration and communication across departments to enhance FinOps practices.
