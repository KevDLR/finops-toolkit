# üõ†Ô∏è Configure managed exports

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è _**Important**<br>Microsoft Cost Management does not support managed exports for Microsoft Customer Agreement billing accounts, billing profiles, invoice sections, and customers. Please [configure Cost Management exports manually](./configure-scopes.md#Ô∏è-configure-cost-management-exports-manually)._

## ‚úÖ Managed export requirements

- Managed exports require granting permissions against the export scope to the managed identity used by Data Factory.  If this is not desireable/feasable use Cost Management exports instead
- Managed exports support EA Enrollment, EA Department and Subscription level imports.
- **MCA Billing Accounts and Billing Profiles are not supported by managed exports.  Rather use [Cost Management exports](./configure-scopes.md#Ô∏è-configure-cost-management-exports-manually).**
- Minimum required permissions for the export scope:
  - _**EA Enrollment:** EA Reader_
  - _**EA Department:** Department Reader_
  - _**Subscription:** Cost Management Contributor_
  
## üõ†Ô∏è Managed export configuration

1. [Grant permissions to Data Factory](./Configure-permissions.md).
2. Add the export scope(s).
   - [using the FinOps Toolkit PowerShell module](#Ô∏è-add-export-scopes-via-the-finops-toolkit-powershell-module)
   - [manually via the Azure Portal](#Ô∏è-add-export-scopes-via-the-azure-portal)
3. Initialize the dataset.
  
  > ‚ÑπÔ∏è _**Important**<br>Ensure not to add duplicate or overlapping export scopes as this will lead to duplication of data._
